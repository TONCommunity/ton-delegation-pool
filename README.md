## Answers on Telegram Contest Key points

#### Describes your project and how users will interact with it 

This project allows anyone to create delegation pool and become validator. Also it allows anyone to earn interest by delegating Grams to potential Validators. (Risks will be handled by reputation system and security deposits). It is non-custodial solution, it is web based solution (all private keys and operations with it are on client side). 
 It is WEB platform features like:
 1. Cross-platform client side wallet
 2. Integrated Dapp that allows to delegate and withdraw funds without CLI

Users will interact with it in two ways. Delegators will just use web based platform or any compatible wallet. They just need to find a delegation pool and send funds to it. They can track statuses of pool via Web platform or can subscribe to the bot notification. Validators can deploy delegation pool via WEB platform. However, to ensure that everything is ok, they will need to use terminal to sign all neccesary data to stake funds from delegation pool to elector pool.

#### Explains how your code should be used to deploy and use your smart contract.


THE BEST WAY to run everything locally is use docker compose

```
docker-compose up
```

We assume that anyone who is going to run this project from scratch is familiar with: C++, Python, Angular, JS, Fift, Func, Go Bash and Zsh as well as MongDB. To run from scracth you will need light client, that will be used by contracts and by api folder. Also you need to have npm installed to build frontend.

To deploy smart contract go to: https://github.com/button-tech/ton-delegation-pool/contracts 

To run backend go to: https://github.com/button-tech/ton-delegation-pool/api

To run frontend go to: https://github.com/button-tech/ton-delegation-pool/front

It is possible to deploy smart contract via WEB frontend only. We use our own backend wrappers over light client to send Boc and run some methods.

# Demo
### Try it [here](https://contest.buttonwallet.com) 
 
1. Create account, use short address and send funds on it
2. Go to Defi => Delegation 

If you have Validator Node - you can create Delegation Pool 

If you do not have it - you can delegate funds by going to Delegate 

Each Delegation pool have multiple statuses for user:

‚ú≥Ô∏è Raising - open to send funds on it. Later Validator will send funds to elector 

üî¥ Fail - If deadline will be exceeded or something went wrong. You can withdraw your funds

üïî Waiting - Wait for your funds to be unfrozen

üí∏ Withdraw - Get your funds back with rewards

We assume that the real commission fees will be significantly lower than right now

# Run and Build

fast way (use our image for run api):

```

full build:
```
# docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-build.yml build
# docker-compose -f docker-compose-full-build.yml up
```

# ToDo:

- [ ] Validator fee commission
- [ ] Security deposit
- [ ] Sub delegation Charity pool and ICO pool

# 3rd party libs:

Thanks to https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK

With https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK/ValeriTon that was used as a base for web version.

We customized these library to deploy our contract and run functions on it
